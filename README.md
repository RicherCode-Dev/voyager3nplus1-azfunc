# Voyager 3n+1 - Azure Function

This project is a simple proof of concept of being able to calculate the 3n+1 Conjecture as part as possible to see how fast I can get through the sequences.  The idea was to leave the project executing as long as possible into the number sequences to see how far to could go to prove or disprove the conjecture.  Sending it off into the unknown, like the Voyager satellites.


# Status

Realised that it could very rapidly get some 1 to 1.7976931348623157E+308 which is the limit of a double in dotnet.  Need to consider if its possible to continue with dotnet as a means to calculate beyond that number or if I need to consider a totally different tech.
